# Learning GoogleTest

Working through the official getting started material and guides in the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/). GoogleTest is a unit testing framework for the C++ programming language. Intention is to get a better understanding on how to work with GoogleTest and also unit testing in general.
